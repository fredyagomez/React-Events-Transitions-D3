# React-Events-D3-Transitions

Simple app to illustrate the utilization of synthetic events in React + D3 Transitions.
Synthetic events tend to create issues when using SVG elements either from D3 or other libraries.
By modifying the SVG components to simple DIV + styling components we can achive this.
